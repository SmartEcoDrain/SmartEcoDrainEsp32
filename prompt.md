Initialize the TinyGsm, you can not initialize the GPRS as we are not using it, only the GSM, SMS and the ESP32 Hotspot

Use the TinyGSMSupabase for the database. 


The setup from the ESP32 hotspot should add a device, we should login the admin account first then add the device, the device should link the admin to know who is the owner of this
Every one can monitor the device but only the owner of this device can manage this 

There should be a device database for the list of devices, the database has:
```
device_id,
location: {
  country: {
    code
    desc
  }
  region: {
    code
    desc
  }
  province: {
    code
    desc
  }
  municipality: {
    code
    desc
  }
  barangay: {
    code
    desc
  }
  postal_code
  street
  fullAddress
}
... other necessary configuration for the device

```

The `location` can be changed from the dashboard,
Do not create database for the address as I have already this on my database, 
Retrieve the `location` from this supabase database:
```
public.address_region: {
  id 
  psgc_code
  reg_desc
  reg_code
}

public.address_province {
  id
  psgc_code
  prov_desc
  reg_code
  prov_code 
}

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.address_citymun (
    id
    psgc_code
    citymun_desc
    reg_code
    prov_code
    citymun_code
);

public.address_brgy {
    id
    brgy_code
    brgy_desc
    reg_code
    prov_code
    citymun_code
}
```


The user should have a role, admin or user. 
The admin can modify, add, delete a device they created.
The user can only monitor the devices.
The auth.user should have a metadata called address:
```
address:  {
  country: {
    code
    desc
  }
  region: {
    code
    desc
  }
  province: {
    code
    desc
  }
  municipality: {
    code
    desc
  }
  barangay: {
    code
    desc
  }
  postal_code
  street
  fullAddress
}
name: {
  suffix
  last_name
  first_name
  middle_name
}
age
gender
birthday
phone_number
```


Add database called device_data, the database has:

```
device_id
device: {
  cpu_temperature
  signal_strength
  battery_voltage
  battery_percentage
  solar_wattage (make this empty for now or you can code it yourself)
  firmware_version
  online_status
  battery_status
  ... add more other device realtime details, the uptime etc if its online etc, 
  status
  message
}
module: {
  tof0
  tof...
  force0
  force...
  weight0
  weight...
  turbidity0
  turbidity...
  ultrasonic0
  ultrasonic...
  ... can add other realtime monitoring modules, for future use
  status (generated by the arduino)
  message (generated by the arduino)
}
... add necessary items
```
Note the modules can be any number and any modules but the default was shown
Create also the supabase table for that, create interface too for that

Create supabase trigger that will check if the esp32 was online


Create the code for the Esp32 and the React.js, Next.js + HeroUI (previously NextUI)


Remember that on the first the we should register the device to the database, via hotspot 

Create the code for the Supabase RPC and Database, Esp32 and the React.js, Next.js + HeroUI (previously NextUI)
